# Infant-Mortality-Rtae
Implemented a Decision Tree Regressor from scratch, achieving a test set RMSE of 8.45, with methods for optimal 
splits (variance reduction) and human-readable tree visualization. 
Trained and evaluated the model on a dataset with N samples, improving interpretability and forecasting 
accuracy for infant mortality rates.
Benchmarked against a Linear Regression model, demonstrating a 55% improvement in predictive performance.
